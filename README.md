# Raw Implementation of Neural Network

This repository is focused on my learning of neural networks.\
Here I program a neural networks from ground up avoiding as much use of library functions as possible.\
The main goal of this repository is to understand the raw basics of AI and neural networks.

## Perceptron

The `c_perceptron` contains implementation of raw implementation of the mathematical model of a perceptron.\
This perceptron is capable of classifying rectangles and circles of arbitrary shape and location in a 100x100 image.\
Refer to `c_perceptron/README.md` directory if you want to download and test.
